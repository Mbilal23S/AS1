            This course module has truly stood out as a remarkable learning journey for me! The instructor's commitment is truly exceptional, ensuring clarity and understanding of every concept for all students. One of the most beneficial features is the access to recorded lectures, which empowers students to review missed content at their own convenience, enhancing overall comprehension.
            I plunged eagerly into this module, driven by a relentless curiosity about the construction of websites. Every week's lecture unveiled the magic behind web development, keeping me engaged and excited to learn more. However, I encountered a hurdle, I fell behind on my personal learning goals, the self-paced targets I'd set to solidify my understanding. This misstep caused a dip in my motivation, and I worried about catching up and finishing the assignments on time. However, I was determined not to let it sidetrack me. I picked myself up, tackled those missed targets, and quickly found my groove again. My interest reignited, and I finished the module with a renewed sense of passion for web development!
            
            Building my own website was one of the most challenging projects I've ever undertaken. It was also my first solo Endeavor. Previously, I collaborated on a project for the Clay brook Zoo website. It was an enjoyable experience as each member of the group contributed with innovative ideas. When I started building this website, I was overwhelmed by design choices ,colour schemes, fonts, the whole layout. Ultimately, I decided to keep it simple, leveraging the skills I gained from the course and focusing on what I could confidently create.
